## Deployment
Deployment process as easy as possible:
Required software:
- terminal for running bash scripts
- docker
- docker-compose

to deploy application, uncomment strings 13-15, switch to needed branch and run bash script:

$ bash start.sh ${bot_username} ${bot_token} ${admins_list}


or  wright these parameters directly in the script and run it;

That's all.
